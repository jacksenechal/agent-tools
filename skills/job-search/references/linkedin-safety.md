# LinkedIn Safety Protocol

**Getting banned from LinkedIn would be catastrophic. These rules are non-negotiable.**

The browser automation MCP server controls a browser with the user's real LinkedIn session.
LinkedIn monitors for automation through timing patterns, repetitive access, and unnatural
browsing behavior. Behavioral detection is the primary risk.

## Rules

### 1. WebFetch First
Always try `WebFetch` for job posting data before resorting to browser automation. Job postings
are often semi-public and WebFetch avoids triggering any LinkedIn automation detection.

### 2. Page Load Limits
- **Job posting scrape**: 1 LinkedIn page load
- **Connection search**: Up to 10 LinkedIn page loads per job (1 for 1st-degree search,
  up to 8 for paging through 2nd-degree results, plus breather navigations to google.com
  which don't count)
- **Per session/conversation**: Max 25 total LinkedIn page loads across all activities
- Track your count mentally. When you hit the limit, STOP.
- **Always use breather pages** (google.com) between LinkedIn page loads — these don't count
  toward the limit but are mandatory for safety.

### 3. Never View Individual Profiles
Do not navigate to any individual LinkedIn profile URL (linkedin.com/in/...) automatically.
The connection search uses search result pages only, which show
connection summaries without triggering profile view notifications or tracking.

### 4. Mandatory Randomized Delays
After EVERY `browser_navigate` to any linkedin.com URL:
1. Call `browser_wait` with a **randomized** duration between 3000-8000ms
2. Never use round numbers (use 4200, 6700, 3100, 5800 — not 3000, 5000, 8000)
3. Never use the same delay twice in a row

### 5. Natural Scrolling Pattern
After the page loads and the wait completes, simulate natural reading:
1. `browser_press_key` with `PageDown` → `browser_wait` 1500-3000ms
2. Simulate some small random mouse movements
2. `browser_press_key` with `PageDown` → `browser_wait` 2000-4000ms
3. Optionally scroll back up with `PageUp` → `browser_wait` 1000-2000ms
4. THEN take a `browser_snapshot` to read the content

### 6. Breather Pages
Between LinkedIn page loads, navigate to a non-LinkedIn URL:
- `browser_navigate` to `google.com` or the company's own website
- Wait 1000-2000ms
- Then navigate to the next LinkedIn page

This breaks up repetitive linkedin.com access patterns in the browser history.

### 7. Write Actions — Forbidden, With One Narrow Exception

**Permanently forbidden. Never automate ANY of these:**
- Sending connection requests
- Sending messages or InMail
- Clicking "Easy Apply" or submitting any application
- Endorsing skills or writing recommendations
- Liking, commenting, or sharing posts
- Following or unfollowing companies or people
- Editing the user's own profile
- Anything that touches the social graph or is visible to another person

These are ALWAYS done manually by the user. No exceptions, no "just this once."

**The one exception — the user's own saved-jobs list.** The pipeline orchestrator may
archive or un-save entries in *the user's own* saved-jobs list (`My Items → My Jobs`) to
keep it in sync with `tracker.csv`. This was deliberately authorized by the user on
2026-07-27 to enable the sync loop.

Why this is materially different from everything above: it is private bookkeeping on the
user's own saved items. Nothing is published, nothing reaches another person's notifications,
and nothing touches the social graph — which is what LinkedIn's abuse detection is primarily
built to catch. It is not risk-free, so it is fenced:

- **Only** archive / un-save / restore on the saved-jobs list. Nothing else on the page.
- **Max 10 write actions per session**, and they count double against the 25-page budget
  (each write = 2 page loads).
- Full §4 and §5 treatment on every write: randomized delay, natural scroll, breather page.
- **Never bulk-clear.** If more than 10 entries need syncing, do 10 and leave the rest for
  the next run.
- On ANY anomaly (§8 CAPTCHA, unexpected dialog, layout you don't recognize), abort the
  write immediately and fall back to read-only for the rest of the session.
- Every write is logged to the §10 audit trail with the job id and the action taken.

If in doubt, don't write. A stale saved list is a trivial problem; a restricted LinkedIn
account is not.

### 8. CAPTCHA / Unusual Activity Detection
If a `browser_snapshot` or `browser_screenshot` reveals:
- A CAPTCHA challenge
- An "unusual activity detected" message
- A login/verification prompt
- Any security checkpoint

**Immediately:**
1. Stop ALL LinkedIn browser operations for the rest of the session
2. Navigate to `google.com`
3. Alert the user with a clear warning
4. Do NOT attempt to solve or bypass the challenge

### 9. Session Hygiene
- At the start of any LinkedIn browsing, take a `browser_screenshot` first to verify
  the browser is in a normal state (logged in, no warnings)
- At the end of LinkedIn browsing, navigate to `google.com` to cleanly exit
- Never leave a LinkedIn page open in the background while doing other browser work

### 10. Audit Trail
If configured, browser navigations can be logged to `~/workspace/jobs/linkedin-audit.log`
via a Claude Code hook. This creates accountability. If the user asks how many LinkedIn pages
were accessed, check this log.

## Example Safe Connection Search Sequence

Single semantic search for 1st+2nd degree connections who currently work at the company,
paging through all results.

```
Search URL:
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=my%20connections%20who%20currently%20work%20at%20<COMPANY>&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&network=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D

--- page 1 ---
1.  browser_screenshot                          # Verify browser state
2.  browser_navigate → search URL               # LI page load #1
3.  browser_wait(4700)                          # Randomized delay
4.  browser_press_key(PageDown)                 # Natural scroll
5.  browser_wait(2200)
6.  browser_press_key(PageDown)
7.  browser_wait(1800)
8.  browser_snapshot                            # Read results
9.  browser_navigate → google.com               # Breather
10. browser_wait(2500)

--- page 2 (if more results) ---
11. browser_navigate → next page URL            # LI page load #2
12. browser_wait(5300)
13. browser_press_key(PageDown) + waits          # Natural scroll
14. browser_snapshot                            # Read results
15. browser_navigate → google.com               # Breather
16. browser_wait(3100)

(repeat for each page, up to 8 total LI page loads)

--- done ---
17. browser_navigate → google.com               # Clean exit
```

Total LinkedIn page loads: up to 8 per job.
Each page shows ~10 results, so 8 pages covers ~80 connections.
Past 2nd degree is useless — don't bother with 3rd+ degree searches.

# Coherence Pipeline: discovery, vetting, application

The end-to-end loop for finding roles at organizations worth working for, deciding which are,
and preparing the applications. Three stages, each a sub-command, chained by `pipeline`.

```
scout  ──►  vet  ──►  add (Stages 1-5)  ──►  user applies
 find        score      research, resume,      (never automated)
 companies   tier 1     form, responses
 first       verdict
```

The framework itself (definition, mechanism, the eight dimensions, the probes) lives in the
user's private repo, `~/workspace/jobs/strategy/coherence.md`; the runnable instrument in
`coherence-instrument.md`; the scored cases in `coherence-cases.md`. This file is the operating
procedure. It carries no personal data.

## Why companies first

Searching by job title returns every open req at every company and leaves the quality judgment
to the resume-tailoring stage, which is the expensive one. Searching for companies that produce
the artifacts of a coherent organization (a public handbook, an RFC process, a postmortem archive,
a founder still in the seat, revenue that depends on the product) and only then looking for a
matching req inverts that. The first run found six companies with nine matching roles in ten
minutes and fifteen tool calls; three read Advance at vetting, against roughly one in five from
the organic inflow.

The inversion is a candidate generator, not a verdict. One company hit the artifact signals
perfectly and read *extraction* on its employees at vetting. Every hit gets vetted.

## Kick-off

```
/job-search pipeline
```

or the stages separately:

```
/job-search scout --minutes 10 --max 15
/job-search vet --all-unvetted
/job-search add <url>          # for each Advance row with a live posting
```

## Stage 1: scout

Inputs: the role profile (titles, seniority, domain lean) and the geographic filter. Output:
tracker rows at `discovered` with a scout note, and a hits table.

Rules that matter:
- **Geography is a hard filter at the posting's own location line.** Remote (US) or the
  configured metro. Greenhouse posts one req per country; take the right one. Aggregators lie
  about location; the posting does not.
- **Exclude the tracker** (any stage) and companies with a layoff in the last 18 months.
- **Time box.** Ten minutes and ~25 calls. Candidate selection is nearly free (the artifact
  signals are memorable); the budget goes to "is there an open req right now."
- **ATS-restricted search** (`site:greenhouse.io`, `site:ashbyhq.com`, `site:lever.co`) cuts the
  content-marketing noise that a plain "engineering manager <company>" query returns.
- **Never silently cap.** Say which candidates were left unchecked.

## Stage 2: vet

Inputs: company name. Output: `coh_cell`, `coh_derivative`, `coh_verdict`, `coh_date`, `coh_tags`
on every row for that company, a note, and an entry in the cases file. The tags carry what the
verdict hides (which flag, which gap, how thin the evidence), so the tracker view can show the
measurement (level, trend, tags) and keep the verdict as a small action label.

The tier-1 read is ~30 minutes of summary pages for a person and 7-14 tool calls for an agent:
employee side (Glassdoor with n, Blind as the friction-gated source, the directional rule under
n=30), customer side (Gartner Peer Insights first, G2 with provenance labels second), five
windowed structural flags, a growth-absorption check when headcount doubled, turn signals,
self-production artifacts, a seam glance, and a seed read for small companies (founder prior
record, co-founder stability, Wayback team-page diff, round structure, pulled-vs-pushed, req
shape). The instrument specifies all of it; the agent reads that section and follows it.

Verdicts and what happens to the row:
| Verdict | Meaning | Tracker action |
|---|---|---|
| Advance | founder-led or partnership, no shock in window, artifacts at bar | candidate for `add` |
| Price | a shock, an extraction cell, a ceiling gap, or a Blind gap | stays; research only if the role is otherwise compelling; tier 2 before investing |
| Pass | employee side unhappy plus two or more flags | `withdrawn`, note `coherence Pass` |
| Unknown | no employee sample, seed read recorded | stays; the seed note is the next step |

Batch limit: 12-15 companies per session (shared WebSearch quota). Browser fallback exists.

## Stage 3: add, for Advance rows

The existing pipeline, Stages 1-5 in `SKILL.md`. Three things the coherence pass feeds into it:
- **Confirm the posting is live and US-eligible before Stage 2.** Two of the first run's nine
  hits were dead links; one was Berlin-only. Fetch the posting, read the location line.
- **The tier-2 Glassdoor capture is the loop-question source.** The negative tail names the
  mechanism to ask about (how expectations are written before a review, how comp changed, what
  happened the last time someone pushed back, how often teams re-form). Put those in
  `brief.md` so they travel with the application.
- **Watch items.** A closed req that was the better fit (reports to a founder, AI-native, public
  artifacts) goes in the tracker as `closed` with a watch note and gets mentioned in outreach.

## Shape of a run

From the first full run (one afternoon):
- scout: 6 companies, 9 roles, 15 calls
- vet: 3 Advance, 3 Price, 0 Pass, 0 Unknown
- add: of the 3 Advance companies, 1 live and eligible posting; 1 dead link, 1 wrong geography,
  1 phantom req (existed, closed). One full application package produced, ready to apply, with a
  connections map of 55 second-degree contacts and three bridges.

The lesson for the next run is in the geographic filter and the "confirm live" step above.

# Playwright Docker Skill

Manages a Dockerized Playwright + noVNC browser for Claude Code automation. Built on
[xtr-dev/mcp-playwright-novnc](https://github.com/xtr-dev/mcp-playwright-novnc) (git
submodule) with minimal modifications for Claude Code compatibility.

**Assets location**: `~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets/`

## Architecture

### Hybrid Golden + Isolated Sessions

Two MCP servers run in the same container on different ports:

| | Isolated (default) | Golden |
|---|---|---|
| **Port** | 3080 | 3081 |
| **Mode** | `--isolated` (ephemeral) | `--cdp-endpoint` → persistent Chromium |
| **Auth** | Loaded from exported storage state | Maintained via noVNC login |
| **Parallelism** | Fully parallelizable | Single-client only |
| **Use case** | All agent work (scraping, form filling) | Logging into sites, maintaining sessions |

**Flow**: User logs into sites via golden session (noVNC) → export storage state → isolated sessions automatically load cookies.

### Components

- **Docker container** (`playwright-display`): Runs persistent golden Chromium + two Playwright MCP servers + noVNC
- **MCP connection**: Claude Code connects via `mcp__playwright__` tools (stdio → SSE proxy)
- **noVNC**: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html — watch or manually interact with the browser
- **Golden session** (port 3081): Persistent browser profile for logins
- **Isolated sessions** (port 3080): Ephemeral browsers pre-loaded with exported auth state

### Upstream modifications

The upstream source lives in `assets/mcp-playwright-novnc/` as a **git submodule**. We
overlay changes without modifying it:

1. **`--output-dir /tmp/.playwright-mcp`** (in `start-mcp.sh`) — Claude Code sends MCP
   `roots` with host paths that don't exist in the container (EACCES workaround).
2. **Local image build** — upstream GHCR package is private/unavailable.
3. **Custom `supervisord.conf`** — adds golden browser + golden MCP server processes.
4. **`start-golden-browser.sh`** — launches persistent Chromium with `--user-data-dir` and CDP on port 9222.
5. **`start-mcp-golden.sh`** — golden MCP server that connects to golden Chromium via `--cdp-endpoint`.
6. **`export-storage-state.js`** — exports auth state from golden browser via Playwright CDP.
7. **Custom `entrypoint.sh`** — fixes Docker volume ownership before starting supervisord.

## Prerequisites

Before any sub-command, ensure the submodule is initialized and the image exists.

**All `docker compose` commands require `RESUME_REPO_PATH`** (the compose file mounts it
as a volume). Set it before every docker compose invocation:

```bash
export RESUME_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/resume
```

The jobs repo is also mounted (for per-job tailored résumé uploads at
`applications/<id>/resume.pdf`); it defaults to `~/workspace/jobs`, so `JOBS_REPO_PATH` only
needs setting if that repo lives elsewhere.

```bash
# Initialize submodule (no-op if already present)
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools
git submodule update --init skills/playwright-docker/assets/mcp-playwright-novnc

# Build image (uses cache if unchanged, safe to run repeatedly)
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose build
```

## Sub-Commands

### `setup` — First-time setup

Run once to start the container and wire up the MCP server in Claude Code.

#### 1. Build and start the container

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools
git submodule update --init skills/playwright-docker/assets/mcp-playwright-novnc

cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose up -d --build
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
docker ps | grep playwright-display
```

noVNC is at http://localhost:6080/vnc.html. The golden Chromium browser starts
automatically. Isolated browsers launch on the first MCP tool call.

#### 2. Add the MCP server (user-scoped, persists across all projects)

Check if already configured:
```bash
grep -q playwright ~/.claude.json && echo "already configured"
```

If not, add the isolated session MCP server (default for all agent work):
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport sse playwright http://localhost:3080/sse
```

Tools will be available as `mcp__playwright__browser_*`.

> **Why direct SSE, not a `docker run … mcp-proxy` wrapper?** The container already
> publishes 3080/3081 on the host, so Claude Code can speak SSE straight to the in-container
> MCP server. The old `docker run --rm -i … mcp-proxy …` form spawned a throwaway stdio↔SSE
> bridge container **per conversation**; because `--rm` only fires on container stop and the
> proxy process doesn't reliably exit when the client disconnects, these leaked and piled up
> (random-named `mcp-playwright-novnc:local` containers). Direct SSE has identical exposure
> (same published ports) with nothing to leak. To clean up legacy proxies:
> `docker ps --filter "ancestor=mcp-playwright-novnc:local" --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -v '^playwright-display$' | xargs -r docker rm -f`

#### 3. Verify

Call `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to `https://google.com` and confirm
`mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` returns content.

### `golden open` — Start using the golden session

The golden Chromium browser starts automatically with the container (visible in noVNC).
To connect Claude Code to the golden session for automation:
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport sse playwright-golden http://localhost:3081/sse
```

Tools are then available as `mcp__playwright-golden__browser_*`.

**Important**: Only one client should use the golden session at a time (user via noVNC
or Claude Code, not both simultaneously).

### `golden export` — Export auth state to isolated sessions

After logging into sites in the golden session, export cookies and localStorage:

```bash
docker exec -e NODE_PATH=/app/node_modules playwright-display node /usr/local/bin/export-storage-state.js /home/pwuser/state/storage-state.json
```

This writes a Playwright storage state file. The isolated MCP server loads `--storage-state`
at process startup, so after exporting you need to restart the container for isolated
sessions to pick up the new auth state:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose restart
```

Then reconnect MCP (`/mcp` or new conversation). The golden session's logins are unaffected
by the restart (profile persists in a Docker volume).

To verify the export:
```bash
docker exec playwright-display cat /home/pwuser/state/storage-state.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20
```

### `golden close` — Remove golden MCP server from Claude Code

If you no longer need direct automation of the golden session:
```bash
claude mcp remove playwright-golden
```

The golden browser process continues running in the container (logins persist).

---

### `start` — Start the container

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose up -d --build
```

### `stop` — Stop the container

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose down
```

### `restart` — Restart the container

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose restart
```

**Important**: After any restart, the SSE connection drops and the in-container MCP server
issues fresh session IDs. Either start a new Claude Code conversation or run `/mcp` to reconnect.

### `status` — Check health

```bash
docker ps --filter name=playwright-display --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

Check both MCP servers are responding:
```bash
# Isolated (3080)
curl -s http://localhost:3080/sse -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"
# Golden (3081)
curl -s http://localhost:3081/sse -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"
```

Also confirm MCP connectivity: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to `https://google.com`.

### `update` — Pull upstream changes

```bash
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools
git submodule update --remote skills/playwright-docker/assets/mcp-playwright-novnc

cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets
docker compose up -d --build
```

This pulls the latest upstream commit, rebuilds the image, and restarts the container.
After updating, reconnect the MCP server (new conversation or `/mcp`).

---

## Troubleshooting

### `MCP error -32603: HTTP 404: Session not found`

The in-container MCP server recycled its session after a restart while Claude Code still held
the old session ID. Fix: start a new conversation or run `/mcp` to reconnect. If it persists,
restart the container (`docker compose restart`) then reconnect.

### `mcp__playwright__` tools not available

The MCP server isn't connected. Check:
1. Container running? `docker ps | grep playwright-display`
2. MCP configured? `grep playwright ~/.claude.json`
3. If both yes, run `/mcp` to reconnect.

### `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir`

The `--output-dir` workaround isn't active. Check that `start-mcp.sh` is mounted:
```bash
docker exec playwright-display cat /usr/local/bin/start-mcp.sh | grep output-dir
```

### Golden session: "browser already in use" lock error

Only one client can connect to the golden session (port 3081) at a time — the noVNC user and
Claude Code can't both drive it. Make sure you're not connected via `/mcp` while also using
noVNC. If a connection is wedged, `docker compose restart` clears it (golden profile persists).

### Storage state not loading in isolated sessions

1. Check the file exists: `docker exec playwright-display ls -la /home/pwuser/state/storage-state.json`
2. Check start-mcp.sh sees it: `docker exec playwright-display cat /var/log/supervisor/playwright-mcp.log | grep "Storage state"`
3. `--storage-state` is loaded at MCP server startup, not per-connection. After exporting,
   restart the container (`docker compose restart`) then reconnect (`/mcp`).

---

## Using the Browser Tools

Once set up, use `mcp__playwright__` tools in any skill or task:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` | Capture accessibility tree (primary scraping method) |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_click` | Click an element |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_type` | Type into a field |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_press_key` | Press a key (Enter, ArrowDown, Tab, etc.) |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_select_option` | Select from standard `<select>` dropdown |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload` | Upload a file programmatically |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` | Capture a screenshot |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` | Wait for an element or condition |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_hover` | Hover over an element |

### File uploads

Use `browser_file_upload` with the container-internal path. Two repos are mounted read-only:

- **Per-job tailored résumé** (the usual upload): the jobs repo is at `/home/pwuser/jobs/`, so
  upload `/home/pwuser/jobs/applications/<id>/resume.pdf`.
- **Canonical résumé** (untailored): the resume repo is at `/home/pwuser/resume/`, so
  `/home/pwuser/resume/resume.pdf`.

(The jobs-repo mount defaults to `~/workspace/jobs`; override with `JOBS_REPO_PATH`. Recreate the
container after adding the mount for it to take effect.)

### CAPTCHA / Security Challenge Detection

After every `browser_snapshot` or `browser_screenshot`, check for:
- CAPTCHA challenges (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, puzzle challenges, "verify you are human")
- "Unusual activity detected" or "suspicious activity" messages
- Login/verification prompts that weren't expected
- Any security checkpoint or bot-detection interstitial

**If detected, IMMEDIATELY:**
1. **STOP** all browser automation — do not attempt another action on the site
2. Navigate to `google.com` to leave the blocked page
3. **Ask the user** to resolve it manually via noVNC at http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
4. **Wait** for the user to confirm the challenge is resolved before resuming
5. Do NOT attempt to solve, bypass, or retry past the challenge

This applies to ALL sites — LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, or any other.
Captchas are a signal that automation has been detected; continuing will make it worse.

## Container Lifecycle

The container is configured with `restart: unless-stopped`, so it survives reboots.
The golden session's browser profile persists across restarts via a Docker named volume.

```bash
export RESUME_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/resume
cd ~/workspace/agent-tools/skills/playwright-docker/assets

docker compose up -d --build  # Start/rebuild
docker compose restart        # Restart (reconnect MCP after)
docker compose down           # Stop (golden profile preserved)
docker compose down -v        # Stop and delete golden profile + storage state
```

---

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- ~3GB disk for the locally-built image
- ~1GB RAM while running (+ ~500MB for golden session browser)
- Ports 6080 (noVNC), 3080 (isolated MCP), and 3081 (golden MCP) available locally
